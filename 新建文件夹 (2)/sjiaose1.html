Later, he was fostered by his father's distant relatives, Fujiwara and his wife. He lived in the small town where her grandmother Xia mulingzi once lived. From Lingzi's remains, we can get & quot; Friends account;, So he decided to return the names of the monsters who had made the contract one by one. In the life of returning the name together with the cat teacher (spot) who looks like a Fortune Cat, he gradually learns to get along well with human beings and monsters.</p>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since childhood, both parents have lost their lives, and they have been living among relatives. Now they are adopted by the kind-hearted Fujiwara couple. I like cats and hate thunder and celery. When he was young, he was bullied because he saw monsters but could not be understood by others. As a result, although he was kind to others, he was still used to hiding his true thoughts. I cherish my life very much( Once said & quot; I feel very happy from the bottom of my heart ) After learning the particularity of the friend account, he began to return the name of the monster with ban Yi. When he returns his name, Xia mulingzi's memory will be transformed into missing and spread to his mind, which will make him know his grandmother more and consume a lot of physical strength every time he returns his name. Because they have a similar face to their grandmother, and because of the relationship between their grandparents and grandchildren, they have a similar smell to their grandmother, xiamu Lingzi (monsters use smell to distinguish human beings, and they don't pay attention to gender), so they are often mistaken for xiamu Lingzi.<br />
                      The secret popularity among girls in school can be seen in the ninth episode of the third season and the fifth episode of the fourth season of xiamu yourenzhang animation TV edition, but I am so slow that I don't feel it at all.</p>
