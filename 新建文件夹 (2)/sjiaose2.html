                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Cat teachers like to drink, and the stomach is very big, very can eat. I've been angry with xiamu and become xiamu Lingzi to blackmail xiamu's classmates for dinner and drain their wallets; The cat teacher walks around. She's a typical greedy cat, and she's growing in weight and size. After getting drunk, he likes to sing disorderly (sound crazy and hard to hear). He usually likes to tease and bully the weak. He is also arrogant and sometimes makes a fool of himself; He often quarrels with xiamu because of trifles, but although he talks about it to protect his friends, he will turn back to protect xiamu when he is in danger. He likes to lie on Guizhi's shoulder when he appears in the form of Fortune Cat. Because we get along with each other for a long time, we have feelings for xiamu and decide to accompany her for a lifetime. After having a tantrum with Xia mu, I heard that a monster wanted to hurt Xia Mu and then capture his friend's account, so I resolutely turned back to fight with the monster. Black and blue after the mouth said hard & quot; I don't care what the xiamu guy looks like. Anyway, it's just fine. In short, many plots can reflect the warmth between the cat teacher and Xia mu.</p>
