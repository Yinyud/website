According to Guizhi, she was the mother who gave birth to Guizhi. Lingzi is called a liar by people who don't believe in monsters because she can see monsters. She is bullied, but she still goes her own way. Although they say they hate human beings, in fact, they are eager for human friends. A cheerful girl with a touch of sadness warms the hearts of monsters in her own unique way.

According to the monsters, they are very powerful. They use bats to fight and know how to use arrays to defeat many powerful monsters (such as C and San Zhen).</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lingzi in the play has a lot of moving points. She uses her gentle and optimistic heart to cure many monsters. When people and monsters don't understand Lingzi's mind, they think that what she does is very strange and unreasonable, and even think that Lingzi is playing tricks on others. When the truth came out, she found that Lingzi was so delicate that she imagined for others all the time. For example, hang the contract sheet of a monster Wuye (a timid mengzhengtai) on a small tree and let the monster take it 50 years later. 50 years later, when the monster went to the woods, he found that the trees had grown up and he couldn't find the contract, so he came to Guizhi for help. The genie had inadvertently mentioned that he wanted to see the sea with his own eyes, but he could not leave the forest. In the end, with Guizhi's encouragement, the monster overcame his inner timidity and climbed up the high tree to get the contract. At the moment when he got the contract, he found that he could see the distant sea from the height of the branch where the contract sheet was located.</p>
